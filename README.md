## Credit Card Approval Prediction Project

This repository contains a project focused on predicting individuals' chances of credit card approval. Leveraging various machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the likelihood of an individual's credit card application being approved by financial institutions.

### Data Input Requirements

The project requires a dataset consisting of diverse demographic and financial attributes, including but not limited to:

- **Gender**: The gender of the applicant (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Age**: The age of the applicant in years.
- **Marital Status**: The marital status of the applicant (e.g., Married, Single, Divorced).
- **Education Level**: The highest level of education attained by the applicant (e.g., High School, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree).
- **Income**: The annual income of the applicant.
- **Employment Status**: The employment status of the applicant (e.g., Employed, Unemployed, Self-Employed).
- **Number of Dependents**: The number of dependents or family members supported by the applicant.
- **Credit History**: The applicant's credit history, including factors such as past loans, repayment behavior, and credit score.
- **Property Ownership**: Whether the applicant owns any property or real estate.
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The ratio of the applicant's debt obligations to their gross income.
- **Housing Type**: The type of housing the applicant resides in (e.g., Rent, Own).
- **Previous Credit Card Usage**: Information about the applicant's previous use of credit cards, if any.
- **Other Financial Obligations**: Any other financial commitments or obligations the applicant may have.

By analyzing these features and their relationships with credit card approval decisions, the project aims to develop predictive models that can estimate the probability of an individual's credit card application being approved. Through this analysis, users can gain insights into the factors influencing credit card approval decisions and make informed decisions regarding their financial choices.

## Model Performance Summary
